## Deployed Site
Click [here](https://blueberry-pudding-93261.herokuapp.com/ "MIXR App") to check out our app. 

## Description
An application built for users to be able to interact with drink menus easier and more effectively by allowing users to search a bar or restaurants cocktail menu by liquor type and/or specific ingredients. The user will also be able to save their favorite drinks as well as like/dislike certain drinks. Other users will be able to see which drinks are the highest rated and then will even be able to avoid busy bar areas by ordering right from their seat and have their drink brought out to them. Lastly, the user can go back and find their favorite drinks and click on them to see all of the ingredients, as well as directions on how to make it and a button to add all of the ingredients to their Amazon shopping cart to have them sent right to their door.
